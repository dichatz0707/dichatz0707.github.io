            <p class="blogtext">Roberto Carlos da Silva Rocha (born 10 April 1973), more commonly known as Roberto Carlos, is a Brazilian
                former
                professional footballer who now works as a football ambassador. He started his career in Brazil as a
                forward
                but spent most of his career as a left back and has been described as the "most offensive-minded
                left-back in
                the history of the game". Carlos is also widely considered one of the best left backs in history, and
                was
                also known as a set piece specialist throughout his career. In 1997, he was runner-up in the FIFA
                World
                Player of the Year. He was chosen on the FIFA World Cup Dream Team, and in 2004 was named by Pelé in the
                FIFA
                100 list of the world's greatest living players.</p>
